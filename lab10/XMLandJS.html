			<h2>1. What is XML?</h2>
			<p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language, which is a markup language used for encoding documents in a format that can be read by both humans and machines. It is a flexible format that can be used for data exchange between different applications and platforms. XML uses tags to define elements and attributes to provide additional information about those elements. Using XML, developers can create whatever tags they need to describe their information.</p>
